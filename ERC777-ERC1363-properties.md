## ERC777: Addressing Shortcomings in Token Standards

**ERC777** is an Ethereum token standard developed to address several shortcomings present in earlier token standards, particularly **ERC20**. And some innovations added.

### Problems Solved by ERC777

1. **Lack of Functionality**: ERC20 tokens are limited in functionality, primarily supporting simple transfers and approvals. ERC777 provides advanced features, including callbacks and operator management.

> Callbacks: It provides more flexible transaction management, more less gas consumption and trigger of events.
> Operator Management:  It provides transaction authorization,  user control, ease of use.

2. **Token Loss Prevention**: ERC20 tokens can get lost if accidentally sent to a contract that doesn't support them. ERC777 prevents such losses by implementing a callback mechanism, allowing the receiving contract to reject tokens.

3. **Reduced Gas Efficiency**: ERC20 transfers require two transactions, increasing gas costs. ERC777 optimizes gas usage by enabling multiple operations in a single transaction.

4. **Approvals Complexity**: Managing approvals for ERC20 tokens can be complex, especially when multiple adresses need approval. ERC777 introduces operator management, simplifying the process approving multiple adresses for token management.

5. **Granularity (Fractional number)**: ERC777 tokens can represent fractional amounts with more precision than ERC20 tokens, which are typically integers.

6. **Backward Compatibility**: ERC777 is designed to be backward compatible with ERC20, making it easier for existing ERC20 tokens to upgrade to the new standard.

## Introduction of ERC1363

**ERC1363** was introduced as a more lightweight and versatile token standard. It builds upon ERC777's improvements while addressing additional concerns.

### Problems Solved by ERC1363

1. **Simplicity**: ERC1363 aims to be simple, making it easier for developers to create and manage tokens. ERC20 and ERC777 are often seen as complex for many use cases. 

2. **Compatibility**: ERC1363 tokens are compatible with both ERC20 and ERC777, allowing for seamless integration with existing token standards.

3. **Gas Efficiency**: Like ERC777, ERC1363 reduces gas usage by allowing multiple operations in a single transaction. This is crucial for optimizing token transfers and interactions on the Ethereum network.

4. **User-Friendly**: ERC1363 simplifies the user experience by allowing token transfers without needing users to first approve a spending allowance.

## Issues with ERC777

While ERC777 addresses many problems associated with earlier token standards, it is not without its own issues:

1. **Complexity**: ERC777's extensive features and capabilities may overwhelm developers who need a simpler token implementation.

2. **Compatibility**: ERC777's features may not be backward compatible with ERC20, potentially causing issues when migrating from older token standards.

3. **Adoption**: ERC777 adoption has been slower than expected, partly due to its complexity and the need to upgrade existing token contracts.

In conclusion, ERC777 and ERC1363 were introduced to address various problems in token standards, with ERC1363 focusing on simplicity, compatibility, and gas efficiency. While ERC777 offers advanced features, it can be complex and less compatible with existing tokens. Developers should carefully consider their specific use cases and requirements when choosing between these token standards.
